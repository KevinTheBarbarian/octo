This is a programming language I started working on to investigate various language design
ideas I had at the time. One goal of the language was to create a C/C++ like structure but
with a more modern and expressive syntax.

Another was to build a framework within which various basic language features like garbage
collection were optional and scoped. For example, libraries using garbage collection could
interoperate safely with deterministic allocation designs.

I eventually moved on to other projects. In retrospect the various plans I had for this
project were not really compatible with each other and perhaps a bit too extreme.
